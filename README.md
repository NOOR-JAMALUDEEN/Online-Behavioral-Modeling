# Online-Behavioral-Modeling
This Python package enables the online discovery of behavioral patterns in trial-by-trial experiments. In trial-by-trial experiments, a participant (human/animal) is exposed to a series of stimuli and is expected to respond. The behavioral pattern is defined as the quantification of the contributions of stimulus features to the prediction of the response, taking into account the effects from prior trials.  

#Format of input data
The behavioral data should be formatted as a pandas dataframe where the trials are chronologically ordered. Each trial/row consists of a stimulus described by a set of features and a corresponding response.
